a card game

some key ideas

every card has 2 faces, you may use either face from your hand

a players turn
    - attack
    - slow actions


players can only play cards that are not fast on their turn during their slow actions phase
fast cards can be played from hand onto the stack during other players turns, or during their slow actions phase

when a player plays a card, if there is no stack, the stack it created, 
then in turn order, each player has an opertunity to play any number of fast card in any order onto the stack
if the opertunity makes it back to the player whose card is on top of the stack, the entire stack resolves

creatures can attack 1 player, make energy, or hold back to block/make energy on an turn opponent's

attacking or making energy drains a creature, they refill at the begining of your next turn

player can block creatures with thier undrained creatures, combat is a simplified magic the gathering combat,
 but damage does not stick after combat or a stack resolves

if a creature hits a player, move cards equal to that creature's offense from the top of the hit players deck into the trash

when the last card is removed from your deck you lose.
